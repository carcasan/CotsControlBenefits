# Analyses of CoTS Control Benefits on the GBR

The scripts presented here run the statistical analysis and produce the figures displayed in the paper: 
'Increasing management efforts of crown-of-thorns sea star outbreaks maximizes ecosystem-wide benefits on corals'

Attached are the model outputs extracted from ReefMod-GBR and CoCoNet assessing CoTS control effort and their ecosystem-wide benefits.

The specific code to run ReefMod-GBR can be found at https://zenodo.org/record/5146061#.YsE_AhVBxPY
